# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is David Lawrence and I am learning to become a software engineer.
The last few years of my life have been quite the roller coaster, but I am
extremely focused and ready to put my skills to good use.
I want to help solve the current large-scale problems in the world via
programming.

It is a dream of mine to work on a team of like-minded individuals who
write code that improves the lives of everyone across the globe.
I won't stop pursuing my dream until it is reality.
